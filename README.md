## My projects üìù


|Project Name| Description| Technology|
|----------------|-----------------|-----|
|Project_1 - Ladle temperature prediction for a steel plant.  (__[github](https://github.com/melloignat/proj_1)__)|Building several models (and selecting the best one based on MAE metric) for a metallurgical plant to find a way to optimize ladle temperature to save costs to heat it during the production process through ladle temperature prediction. Showing ability to do exploratory data analysis and compare different ML models based on the business input. |pandas, sklearn, seaborn,  matplotlib, lightgbm, gridsearch, catboost, randomforest, linear regression |
|Project_2 - Apartment sells data analysis for automated fraud detection system. Example of the in-depth exploratory data analisys (__[github](https://github.com/melloignat/proj_2)__)| Apartment sales data analysis to identify parameters that affects price and selling time. Parameters are needed for the future automated system creation to track anomalies and fraudulent activity. | pandas, matplotlib, numpy |
|Project_3 - Computer games retail sales data analysis for revenue prediction based on open data. (__[github](https://github.com/melloignat/proj_3)__)| We need to identify patterns that determine the success of a game sales, plus perform customers segmentation check for different markets and hypotises verification. This will allow to bet on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns. | pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scipy, seaborn |
|Project_4 - The project to predict gold recovery rate from gold-bearing ore. It will help optimize production line and check business metrics . (__[github](https://github.com/melloignat/proj__4)__)| A prototype of a machine learning model for company X. The company develops solutions for the efficient operation of industrial enterprises. The model must predict the gold recovery rate from gold-bearing ore. You have data on mining and refining parameters. The model will help optimize production allowing not to launch unprofitable business. |  pandas, matplotlib, numpy, sklearn |
